# Schedulers simulations

Project to enable easier and clearer visualization and representation to a progressive building of different CPU scheduling strategies, mechanisms and policies.

It is currently being written whilst reading OSTEP and attending to MIT's 6828 class. These are the sources of material but lots of research and curious-digging happens aside from those two sources. However, all development is being done proactively from scratch by myself as an ""ostude"".


## What is the overall goal?

To have a TUI-like interface that graphically represents, on terminal, simulations of different workloads and how a scheduler might choose each of them to run, at each time.

This graphically representation, at first, intends to follow an axis-chart-like representation instead of a table-like representation.
